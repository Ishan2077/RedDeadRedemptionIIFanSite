				<big><u>Red Dead Redemption 2</u></big>
				stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Grand Theft Auto V as one of the greatest games of the modern age. It’s a gorgeous depiction of an ugly period that’s patient, polished, and a huge amount of fun to play, and it’s combined with Rockstar’s best storytelling to date. Even after finishing the lengthy story I can’t wait to go back and play more. This is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open world ode to the outlaw era. Looking for one of this generation’s very best single-player action experiences? Here’s your huckleberry. <br>

<h2 text="Just a handful of games"><a href="gamesdeveloped.html"> Games Developed </a></h2>
<p> A developer well-known for its forays into action-adventure of different genres, most notably the Grand Theft Auto franchise...until they went to pot when Grand Theft Auto Online turned the series and the company itself into a big microtransactional cash grab and started creating a lot less individual standalone games.</p>
